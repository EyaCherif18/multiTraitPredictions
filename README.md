# multiTraitPredictions
For a wide range of applications, including vegetation modeling in Earth systems models, nature conservation, and forest monitoring, global information on functional plant traits is essential. Yet the coverage of concurrent measurement of multiple plant traits across different ecosystem types is still sparse. With the upcoming unprecedented amount of spectroscopy data, we present here a model that simultaneously retrieve 20 structural and biochemical traits from canopy reflectance data (Multi-trait model). 

This repository is built upon models developed by Cherif et al. 2023, showcasing practical applications through hands-on examples for generating multi-trait maps from Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI). The used model is CNN-based and enables to extract interrelationships from the spectroscopic data and among traits. For in-depth technical insights into the model development process, please refer to the following link: https://gitlab.com/eya95/multi-traitretrieval/

While two HSI examples are provided for testing purposes, users have the flexibility to upload new scenes along with relevant information about the available bands.

For a smoother execution of the code, we have also made available this Colab notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A7edK_jJ4q19ysYPaWbLenT9PcF4FxSJ#scrollTo=8i4K_djURepQ)

# multiTraitPredictions
This repository is built upon models developed by Cherif et al. 2023, showcasing practical applications through hands-on examples for generating multi-trait maps from Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI). For in-depth technical insights into the model development process, please refer to the following link: https://gitlab.com/eya95/multi-traitretrieval/

While two HSI examples are provided for testing purposes, users have the flexibility to upload new scenes along with relevant information about the available bands.
